# Visual Studio Code
An IDE by Microsoft

## Installation
```sh
sudo snap install code --classic
```

Install support for Python and whatever languages you use. The idea is to start lightweight and then extensions as you need them.
I use:

- Docker
- YAML
- GitLens
- vscode-icons
- Material Icon Theme
- One Dark Pro
- Dracula Official
